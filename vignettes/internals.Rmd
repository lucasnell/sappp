This vignette outlines the internal data present in `sappp`. 
These data inform the default parameters (see `vignette("parameters", "sappp")`).


The code was initially set up for 2 clones that have different life histories.
The life histories are taken from lab experiments and correspond to
demographic parameters at 20º and 27º C. See 
[Meisner et al. (2014)](http://doi.wiley.com/10.1890/13-1933.1).


Parameters from this document are saved into 4 lists present in the internal 
data for this package:

|               |                                                                    |
|:--------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dev_times`   | Development times for aphids and wasps                             |
| `populations` | Population rates and starting values for aphids and wasps          |
| `wasp_attack` | Wasp attack rate parameters                                        |
| `environ`     | Parameters associated with environmental effects and stochasticity |


Parameters were wrapped into lists to avoid namespace conflicts and to allow me
to use the same names as those in the paper.



# Development times

Number of days per instar (for low and high temperatures (20º and 27º C)) and
number of days per stage of an aphid being parasitized: living and dead ("mummy"), 
respectively.

```{r instar_mum_days}
dev_times <- list(
    instar_days = list(lowT = c(2, 2, 2, 2, 19), 
                       highT = c(1, 1, 1, 2, 23)),
    mum_days = cbind(7, 3)
)
```



# Populations

Juvenile and adult aphid survival are separated, and all the parameters below have
separate values for clones with high and low survival/reproduction.

```{r population1}
populations <- list(
    # juvenile survival
    surv_juv = list(low = 0.9745, high = 0.9849),
    # adult survival
    surv_adult = list(
        low = rbind(c(1.0000, 0.9949, 0.9818, 0.9534, 0.8805, 0.8367, 0.8532, 0.8786, 
                      0.8823, 0.8748, 0.8636, 0.8394, 0.8118, 0.8096, 0.8240, 0.8333, 
                      0.7544, 0.5859, 0.4155, 0.2216, rep(0, 180))),
        high = rbind(c(1.0000, 0.9986, 0.9951, 0.9874, 0.9675, 0.9552, 0.9550, 0.9549, 
                       0.9462, 0.8992, 0.8571, 0.8408, 0.8281, 0.8062, 0.7699, 0.7500, 
                       0.7559, 0.7649, 0.7240, 0.4367, rep(0, 180)))),
    # reproduction
    repro = list(
        low = rbind(c(0, 2.5925, 4.4312, 5.1403, 5.5190, 5.6633, 5.6010, 5.4577, 5.2904, 
                      5.0613, 4.6970, 3.3577, 1.5946, 1.0817, 0.9666, 0.8333, 0.4689, 
                      0.0709, 0, 0, 0, 0, rep(0, 178))),
        high = rbind(c(0, 3.1975, 5.4563, 6.2996, 6.7372, 6.9030, 6.8210, 6.6100, 
                       6.1962, 5.1653, 4.1837, 3.6029, 3.1023, 2.4799, 1.6909, 1.1750, 
                       1.0148, 0.9096, 0.7821, 0.6430, 0.5000, 0.3531, rep(0, 178))))
)
```


Parameters `K`, `K_y`, and `s_y` are directly from the paper; `sex_ratio` was 
"hard-coded" into the paper's model but is allowed to change here.
The rest were chosen as reasonable starting values for experiments.

```{r population2}
populations[["K"]] <- 4.67e-4        # aphid density dependence
populations[["K_y"]] <- 7.33e-4      # parasitized aphid density dependence
populations[["s_y"]] <- 0.69         # parasitoid adult daily survival
populations[["sex_ratio"]] <- 0.5    # proportion of female wasps
populations[["aphids_0"]] <- 20      # initial density of aphids
populations[["wasps_0"]] <- 1        # initial densities of wasps
populations[["prop_resist"]] <- 0.05 # proportion of resistant clones
```




# Wasp attack


These parameters are from equation 6 in Meisner et al. (2014).

```{r attack_akh}
wasp_attack <- list(
    a = 2.32,       # parasitoid attack rate
    k = 0.35,       # aggregation parameter of the negative binomial distribution
    h = 0.008       # parasitoid attack rate handling time
)
```

Relative attack rates on the different instars from 
[Ives et al (1999)](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/303269).
The code `c(mapply(..., FUN = rep), recursive = TRUE)` converts these values from
per-instar to per-day, based on the 20º and 27ºC development rates.

```{r rel_attack}
wasp_attack[["rel_attack"]] <- list(
    lowT = c(mapply(c(0.12, 0.27, 0.39, 0.16, 0.06), 
                    dev_times$instar_days$lowT, FUN = rep), 
             recursive = TRUE),
    highT = c(mapply(c(0.12, 0.27, 0.39, 0.16, 0.06), 
                     dev_times$instar_days$highT, FUN = rep), 
              recursive = TRUE))
```


Lastly I have the survivals of singly attacked and multiply attacked
resistant aphids.
This is not from the paper, but from unpublished code by Anthony Ives.

```{r attack_surv}
wasp_attack[["attack_surv"]] <- c(0.9, 0.6)
```





# Environment

Parameters associated with environmental effects.

```{r environ}
environ <- list(
    harvest_surv = 0.05,  # aphid survival rate at harvesting
    disp_aphid = 0.05,    # dispersal rates between fields for aphids, adult wasps
    disp_wasp = 1,        # dispersal rates between fields for aphids, adult wasps
    pred_rate = 0.8,      # predation rate for aphids and non-adult wasps
    cycle_length = 30     # time between harvests (typical for alfalfa)
)
```


For fields, it's assumed that only adults are dispersing, but the day at which this 
occurs depends on how quickly the aphids are developing.

```{r disp_start}
environ[["disp_start"]] <-  list(
    lowT = sum(dev_times$instar_days$lowT[1:4]) + 1, 
    highT = sum(dev_times$instar_days$highT[1:4]) + 1)
```

Parameters associated with environmental stochasticity.

`rho` was estimated at 1.0 in Meisner et al. (2014), but that estimate
"... was largely an artifact of the fitting procedure" (p 468).
The number here is from unpublished code by Anthony Ives.

For their simulations, Meisner et al. (2014) multiplied the original estimated 
values of `sigma_x` and `sigma_y` by half to "emphasize the demographic 
stochasticity".
The values below are the original estimated values, not those used for their 
simulations.

```{r process_error}
environ[["sigma_x"]] <- 0.44              # environmental std dev for aphids
environ[["sigma_y"]] <- 0.70              # environmental std dev for wasps
environ[["rho"]] <- signif(               # environmental correlation among instars
    2/(1+exp(-environ[["sigma_y"]]))-1, 2)
```




# Saving data

Saving the created objects as internal data for `sappp`.

devtools::use_data(dev_times, populations, wasp_attack, environ, internal = TRUE)
